78152667,audio,The Sydney J. Freedberg Lecture on Italian Art 1999: Art and Science in the Drawings of Leonardo da Vinci,""<p>James S. Ackerman, professor emeritus of the history of art and architecture, Harvard University Leonardo da Vinci was the only artist of his time to have an intense interest in science. Evident in his sketchbooks, this interest led to his detailed biology and nature studies. In this podcast recorded on November 14, 1999, as part of the Sydney J. Freedberg Lecture on Italian Art series, Professor James S. Ackerman discusses how Leonardo occupied himself by expressing the forces of nature, not just the experience of nature. Leonardo established art as a communication of visual experience and as a means to discover both nature and invention. As Leonardo said, &quot;Painting compels the mind of the painter to transform itself to the very mind of nature—to become an interpreter between nature and art.&quot;</p>"

The Simpson Collection at the National Gallery of Art is one of the few remaining private collections assembled with the participation of artist Auguste Rodin (1840-1917). Most of Rodin's sculpture is sand cast, the main method used in Paris since the mid-19th century, and he usually worked with the foundry established by Alexis Rudier. Jean Limet, a painter by trade, became the appointed patinator of Rodin’s bronzes and photographer of his work. In a joint presentation recorded on February 23, 2015, senior conservator Daphne Barbour and conservation scientist Lisha Glinsman focus on seven bronze sculptures cast during Rodin’s lifetime and gifted by Mrs. John W. Simpson (1869-1943), including the notable works <i>A Burgher of Calais</i>,<b> </b><i>The Kiss</i>, <i>The Thinker</i>, and<i> The Walking Man</i>. Barbour and Glinsman discuss their ongoing research focusing on Rodin’s intrinsic aesthetic realized by his trusted practitioners and preserved in these lifetime casts.</p>"

Richard Norris Brooke enjoyed a long and successful artistic career in Washington, DC. Active in almost every local arts organization, the painter served as vice principal of the Corcoran School of Art from 1902 to 1918. Of the numerous paintings by Brooke that represent African American life in rural northern Virginia, <i>A Pastoral Visit</i> (1881) is the most celebrated. Purchased by the Corcoran Gallery of Art in 1881 and now in the collection of the National Gallery of Art, the work depicts an elderly minister seated at a table with a family of parishioners. The artist portrayed the figures in this large canvas with a degree of humanity and dignity rare in 19th-century images of African Americans, which Brooke criticized as “works of flimsy treatment and vulgar exaggeration.” He grouped the highly individualized figures as a tight domestic unit engaged in a cultural activity important to white and black families alike. In this lecture, delivered on May 14, 2015 as part of the Works in Progress series, Sarah Cash examines this fascinating genre scene in detail, revealing new discoveries and ongoing research about where and when it was painted in Warrenton, Virginia.</p>"

New research conducted at the Gallery has shed an entirely different light on this painting, revealing an original figure that is clearly related to a series of 18 so-called “fantasy figures” by Fragonard—rapidly painted, similarly colored compositions of identical dimensions. In this lecture, delivered on June 15, 2015, as part of the Works in Progress series, John Delaney, Yuriko Jackall, and Michael Swicklik share ongoing technical and art-historical research on <i>Young Girl Reading</i> and its associated works.</p>"

Known for a willingness to embrace new technology and tackle complex projects, Gemini G.E.L. has attracted some of the most innovative artists of our time. The National Gallery of Art has been home to the Gemini G.E.L. Archive since 1981. The archive is intended to include an example of nearly every edition ever published by Gemini G.E.L., as well as selected proof impressions, working materials, and documents. The first exhibitions of the archive organized by the Gallery were <i>Gemini G.E.L.: Art and Collaboration </i>(November 18, 1984-February 24, 1985) and<i> Gemini G.E.L.: Recent Prints and Sculpture</i> (June 5-October 2, 1994). In this lecture recorded on September 18, 1994, exhibition curator Charles Ritchie explores the milestones among the work produced in the previous decade by 24 artists. <i>Gemini G.E.L.: Recent Prints and Sculpture</i> focuses on the workshop’s sensitivity to the pulse of contemporary art and its uncanny ability to reflect the spectrum of modern concerns.</p>"

Hans Haacke (b. 1936, Cologne) is one of the leading figures of conceptual art and one of the most important political artists working today. In 2013, the Collectors Committee of the National Gallery of Art made possible the acquisition of Haacke’s <i>Condensation Wall</i> (1963–1966/2013), a breakthrough kinetic work from the artist's early career. Reflecting Haacke's involvement with the West German-based group Zero, <i>Condensation Wall</i> is part of a set of sculptures, including <i>Condensation Cube and Condensation Floor</i>, that combine geometric shapes and organic materials to reveal physico-dynamical processes. Contemporaneous with minimal sculpture, Haacke's work transforms the industrially fabricated containers of artists like Donald Judd and Larry Bell into barometers: depending on the conditions of the environment, the water inside condenses and evaporates into fog or “rain.” The transparent boxes frame this natural process, the gallery that displays them, and the surrounding artworks. In this lecture, delivered on December 14, 2015 as part of the Works in Progress series, John Tyson considers how Haacke has employed weather for both aesthetic and political ends, exploring the way meteorological projects, such as <i>Condensation Wall</i>, can heighten viewers’ awareness of the normally invisible systems at work in art institutions.</p>"

In honor of the 75th anniversary of the National Gallery of Art, which opened in March 1941, David A. Doheny reassesses the work of its three principal creators—Andrew W. Mellon (1855–1937), David Finley (1890-1977), and Paul Mellon (1907-1999). Andrew Mellon provided its vision, the funds to build and endow it, and his superb art collection to act as a nucleus of a national gallery before his death.&nbsp;David Finley was his principal deputy in this enterprise from its conception in 1927 onward. Paul Mellon was appointed a trustee of the Gallery in 1937 and had a harmonious working relationship with Finley. After the deaths of both Andrew W. Mellon and his architect John Russell Pope within 24 hours of each other, Finley took charge of completing the design and construction of the West Building. Finley was also instrumental in securing important collections for the Gallery, including those of Samuel H. Kress, Joseph E. Widener, Lessing J. Rosenwald, and Chester Dale. In this lecture recorded on April 10, 2016, Doheny uses Finley’s published writings and personal journals to provide insights into his relationships with the Mellons.</p>"

Recent technical examinations have revealed that a bronze bust of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V in the National Gallery of Art, formerly attributed to imperial sculptor Leone Leoni (Milanese, c. 1509–1590), was in fact most likely cast in an unidentified bell or canon foundry. In this lecture held on April 25, 2016, as part of the Works in Progress series at the Gallery, Wendy Sepponen argues that though we do not know who made the portrait, it nevertheless exemplifies the longstanding practice amongst Habsburg rulers to rely on foundries throughout their territories to satisfy their diverse needs for instruments of war and dynastic portraiture, thereby reinforcing the status of bronze as the ideal imperial material.</p>"

He began this work by making a sketch from his source and then recomposing the image for narrative and formal purposes. He traced the drawing onto a canvas, making more adjustments, and then painted the dots using a perforated metal screen as a stencil, imitating industrial printing techniques. Lichtenstein would later refer to this work as his first pop art painting.</p>"

In 1929, Georgia O’Keeffe and Rebecca Strand left their homes and famous photographer-husbands to travel to New Mexico in search of artistic independence. O’Keeffe was established by that time but often felt constrained by the artistic circle around Alfred Stieglitz. Beck Strand was trying to find her way as a painter in the shadow of Paul Strand’s growing success and in a community that seemed to have room for only one woman artist. Strand had a little-sister relationship with O’Keeffe, often dressing and wearing her hair like her better-known friend.&nbsp; During the two summers they spent in Taos, O’Keeffe provided Strand with the support she needed to develop an independent artistic voice and a medium—painting on glass—that she could call her own. For Strand, who settled there permanently in 1933, Taos offered an environment that suited both her swashbuckling public persona and her delicate imagery.

Speaking at the second annual John Wilmerding Symposium on American Art, held on March 23, 2018, at the National Gallery of Art, Nancy Anderson shares how Archibald John Motley Jr.’s moving portrait of his grandmother, Emily Sims Motley, a former slave, speaks to a very different American story.

Driskell, artist, curator, and Distinguished University Professor of Art, Emeritus, University of Maryland at College Park. Archibald Motley Jr.’s paintings of African American subjects underwent drastic changes in style and reception during the artist’s long lifetime. After including Motley’s paintings in his <i>Two Centuries of Black American Art </i>exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 1976, David Driskell visited Motley at his home in 1979 and 1980. Speaking at the second annual John Wilmerding Symposium on American Art, held on March 23, 2018, at the National Gallery of Art, David Driskell presents his recollections of those conversations as well as other impressions of Motley’s work formed during Driskell’s career as an art historian and curator.

The harpsichord, standing at the center of baroque European culture, served not only as a musical instrument but also as a receptacle of painting. Collections in townhouses and mansions from Venice to London and Antwerp to Paris included, alongside traditional easel paintings, harpsichords bearing works by masters as renowned as Jan Brueghel, Annibale Carracci, NoÃ«l Coypel, Christophe Huet, or Sebastiano Ricci. The paintings on harpsichords’ soundboards featured flowers, birds, and insects, connecting these works to Flemish still-life paintings and the celebration of creation. Others presented allegorical, mythological, or vanitas scenes on their lids.</p>"

Mellon Professor, Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts, National Gallery of Art. The Tuscan sculptor Francesco Mochi (1580-1654) has long been viewed as an early innovator of the baroque style whose career was eclipsed by his brilliant younger contemporary Gianlorenzo Bernini. But for his 17th-century biographer, what distinguished Mochi’s sculpture was his determination to adhere to “the Florentine manner.” Estelle Lingo’s new book, <i>Mochi’s Edge and Bernini’s Baroque</i>, argues that the religious and political climate of the later 16th century posed specific challenges for the medium of sculpture, particularly as it had been practiced by Florentine sculptors, most famously Michelangelo. In this lecture held on April 29, 2018, Lingo explores how Mochi’s distinctive sculptural style emerged directly from his attempt to carry forward this 16th-century Florentine tradition and to adapt it to the exigencies of a new era. Mochi’s ambitious undertaking produced some of the century’s most breathtaking and technically sophisticated sculptures, but its inherent tensions also offer new ways of understanding the formation and rise to dominance of Bernini’s mature sculptural style.</p>"

Jacopo Ligozzi (1547–1627), a celebrated draftsman and then head of the Academy of Drawing in Florence, created 22 preparatory drawings in 1608 that were subsequently etched or engraved into full-page plates for the volume. It is the centerpiece of the exhibition <i>Heavenly Earth: Images of Saint Francis at La Verna</i> on view at the National Gallery of Art through July 8, 2018.

498499167,audio,Introduction to the Exhibition—Corot: Women,""<p>Mary Morton, curator and head, department of French paintings, National Gallery of Art. Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot is best known as the great master of landscape painting in the 19th century who bridged the French neoclassical tradition with the impressionist movement of the 1870s. In honor of the opening of the exhibition Corot: Women, Mary Morton argues that Corot’s figure paintings, although constituting a much smaller, less well-known portion of his oeuvre, are of equal importance to the history of art, in particular for the founders of modernist painting such as Paul CÃ©zanne, Pablo Picasso, and Georges Braque. Dressed in rustic Italian costume or nude on a grassy plain, Corot’s women read, dream, and gaze directly at the viewer, conveying a sense of their inner lives. On September 9, 2018, at that National Gallery of Art, Morton explains how Corot’s sophisticated use of color and his deft, delicate touch applied to the female form resulted in pictures of quiet majesty. Corot: Women is on view through December 31, 2018.<br>"

In response to the collage, she brings together different musical sources, overlaying sounds that sit together comfortably at times and create tension at others, giving them the freedom to coexist.</p>"

2897906390001,video,Steve Antosca: HABITAT,""<p>HABITAT, a composition for percussion with video and computer transformations, is a concert-length technology venture by Steve Antosca, percussion performance and video content by Ross Karre, and audio technology by William Brent. Premiered November 10, 2013 in the National Gallery of Art East Building Atrium. The conceptual framework of HABITAT involves a percussionist operating comfortably within the domain of his instruments, emerging over the course of his performance into a larger, more profound environment through his roles as a performer and activator of the technology. This involves his movement to and performance within a “spiral galaxy” of unique percussion stations, distributed throughout the performance space. As the percussionist moves through the space on his transformational journey, a multiplicity of effects—visual, aural, and architectural—enters into the complex formula that comprises the performance of HABITAT. Used uniquely in the Gallery premiere as one of the percussion stations, Harry Bertoia’s <i>Tonal Sculpture </i>(1977) is a gift to the Gallery’s permanent collection from Bernard and Audrey Berman. HABITAT stems from the tradition of intermedia art, in which a variety of media are employed for the mutual benefit of underlying concepts. From the outset of the compositional process, HABITAT treats percussion instruments, monitors, and projection surfaces as installed sculptures and unifying elements of the project. The varying placement and instrumentation that define the percussionist’s journey allow the audience to adjust its auditory perspective through spatialization cues and timbral shifts, constantly reformulating their perception of the performance.</p>"

3578128619001,video,Wyeth Lecture in American Art 2013: Reversing American Art,""<p>In this lecture originally presented on November 20, 2013, speaker Jennifer L. Roberts of Harvard University explores one of the fundamental operations of printmaking—reversal—in order to trace its impact on American art across a spectrum of media. Behind every print lies a matrix (from the Latin for mother): a plate or block or stone or screen from which the print has been &quot;pulled.&quot; And in most printing processes, the final print is a reversed version of the matrix. Although reversal may seem at first to be a simple geometrical switching operation, its material and philosophical complexity is profound; indeed, one may posit a kind of &quot;negative intelligence&quot; that informs any work of art that deploys reversal. To focus on reversal is to open up new ways of thinking about connections among the fine, decorative, and industrial arts in America, not least because so many prominent American artists from the 18th through the 20th century had backgrounds in print and printmaking. &quot;Apprenticed as an engraver&quot;; &quot;trained as a lithographer&quot;; &quot;found initial success as a commercial artist&quot;: such are the typical preludes of American artists' biographies. A rigorous analysis of reversal offers an opportunity to expand the adventure of print from the preludes into the main narratives of the stories we tell about American art. The lecture addresses reversal in several contexts, from the nature prints of Joseph Breintnall in the 1730s to the handprints of Jasper Johns in the 1960s, with a core focus on the later 19th century in the work of James McNeill Whistler and the American trompe-l'oeil painters.</p>"

4161145705001,video,Vasari's Lives of Piero di Cosimo and the Limits of a Teleological System,""<p>Giorgio Vasari wrote two biographies of the Florentine painter Piero di Cosimo: the text published in the second edition of his&nbsp;<i>Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects</i> in 1568 is a much-revised version of the first, printed in 1550. Both works are profoundly teleological, since they are both based on a misleading notion of artistic progress: the first culminating in the figure of Michelangelo, who mastered all three major arts, and the second ending with the eulogy of the Accademia del Disegno, recently founded (1563) under the political auspices of Duke Cosimo I de’ Medici. As Alessandro Nova shows in this lecture, Piero’s lives&nbsp;do not fit the theoretical model, and their meaning can be fully appreciated only when they are embedded in a network that connects Vasari’s&nbsp;<i>rÃ©cit</i>&nbsp;of Paolo Uccello’s biography with his fictional life of Jacopo Pontormo. All three&nbsp;were&nbsp;represented as improper intellectual figures deeply absorbed in their creative process,&nbsp;and&nbsp;their behavior allegedly endangered Vasari’s efforts to promote a new figure of the artist perfectly integrated into the courtly society of his time.​ Recorded on February 18, 2015.</p>"

4206104646001,video,Gauguin: Maker of Myth,""<p>Narrated by Willem Dafoe and with Alfred Molina as the voice of Paul Gauguin, this film was made in conjunction with the exhibition <i>Gauguin: Maker of Myth</i>. Gauguin (1848–1903) abandoned impressionism to create an art driven less by observation than by imagination. His gifts as an artist were matched by a talent for creating myths about places, cultures, and most of all, himself. This film explores his search for an authenticity he felt missing in modern Europe, a search that took him to ever more remote lands: Brittany, Martinique, and Polynesia. Never finding the paradise of his dreams, he recreated it in his paintings, sculpture, drawings, and prints. The film is available for sale at the National Gallery of Art.

A motto painted on the reverse—VIRTUTEM FORMA DECORAT (“Beauty adorns virtue”)—suggests that the young woman’s chastity was as pristine as her flawless complexion.</p>"
4232527462001,video,""The Alba Madonna, Raphael (ASL)"",""<p>The round format of this painting, called a <i>tondo</i>, was popular in Florence, where Raphael lived and learned from fellow masters like Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo from 1504 to 1508. However, this painting represents a turning point. The idealized figures, saturated yet delicate hues, and classical landscape show a shift in style from his intimate Madonnas painted in Florence to a more majestic style developed in Rome after 1508.</p>"
4232538453001,video,""Woman Holding a Balance, Vermeer (ASL)"",""<p>Vermeer echoes the stillness of the instrument held lightly in the woman’s hands with a masterful balance of color, light, and shade throughout the composition. The scene is rendered with acute attention to detail and naturalism but also contains an allegorical subtext. The figure’s action of balancing the scales and her placement in front of a painting depicting the Last Judgment reminds the viewer to live a temperate and virtuous life.</p>"
4232538457001,video,""Self-Portrait, Rembrandt (ASL)"",""<p>Rembrandt painted, drew, and etched dozens of self-portraits over his lifetime. Together, his self-portraits form an extended study of a wide range of human emotions and states of mind. This work was painted shortly after the artist had declared bankruptcy and experienced other hardships. It is tempting to discern an aura of melancholy in the serious expression, but the steady gaze and expressive handling of the paint emphasizing the eyes lends a sense of dignity and strength to the sitter.</p>"
4232538460001,video,""The Old Musician, Manet (ASL)"",""<p>Manet’s tableau reflects on the isolated nature of modern life in this depiction of a group of disparate people. The artist sympathized with the displaced and marginalized poor population, a result of the dramatic redesigning of the Paris that created the now-familiar wide, tree-lined boulevards and neoclassical buildings.</p>"

While the subject of a figure posed in classic contrapposto, in which the body twists, draws from a long artistic tradition, the flattened space of the room, the nearly abstract shapes of the background, and CÃ©zanne’s use of color are innovations that drew on and shaped current artistic debates of the day.</p>"

The artist ensured a good view of his subject by renting a second-story room in the hotel across the street from the church as a temporary studio. Throughout the day, he studied the effects of light and shade on the faÃ§ade and captured them on canvas. Though these look like they might have been painted quickly, conservators have discovered that the paint dried in between layers, which means that Monet worked on the canvases slowly, over a long period of time.</p>"
4232562791001,video,""The Feast of the Gods, Bellini and Titian (ASL)"",""<p>The only artist to surpass the Renaissance painter Bellini’s reputation in Venice was his pupil and collaborator on this painting: Titian. This lively composition, which shows a scene about to erupt with sound and action, was painted for Duke Alfonso d’Este and illustrates Ovid’s poem “The Feasts” (<i>Fasti</i>). The Duke’s guests would have delighted in identifying the classical source and untangling the identities of the dozen gods, goddesses, and mythological beings.</p>"
4232562792001,video,""Daniel in the Lions’ Den, Rubens  (ASL)"",""<p>This painting illustrates the power of Daniel’s faith to protect him from the restless, roaring lions. During the Protestant Reformation, this biblical tale about the trials of an early Christian martyr was used by the Catholic Church to represent perseverance through persecution. Rubens captures the restrained yet menacing energy of the oversized lions with their dynamic poses and lifelike appearance. The strong upward diagonal created by Daniel’s body and red garment indicate the drama of the moment of Daniel’s salvation as the rock sealing the cavernous prison is rolled away.</p>"
4248954210001,video,George Bellows,""<p>Narrated by Ethan Hawke, this film was made in conjunction with the exhibition <i>George Bellows</i>. Bellows arrived in New York City in 1904 and depicted an America on the move. In a twenty-year career cut short by his death at age 42, he painted the rapidly growing modern city—its bustling crowds, skyscrapers, and awe-inspiring construction projects, as well as its bruising boxers, street urchins, and New Yorkers both hard at work and enjoying their leisure. He also captured the rugged beauty of New York's rivers and the grandeur of costal Maine.

Watson was saved, but not before losing his right foot. He went on to enjoy a successful career as a merchant and politician, and proudly recounted his ordeal. Watson commissioned Copley to paint the work for a London orphanage, where it was intended to represent strength through adversity for an audience who could identify with Watson’s background.</p>"
4260552119001,video,""The Repentant Magdalen, La Tour (ASL)"",""<p>The artist brings a highly naturalistic style to this depiction of a mystical moment. The dim interior, illuminated only by a single candle flame, echoes the solemnity of Mary Magdalen’s expression. The candle dramatically highlights the figure’s gaze into the mirror as well as the backlit skull, which she touches lightly. The skull, mirror, and candle flame symbolize the transience of life and the Magdalen’s rejection of a life of luxury to follow Christ.</p>"
4260552121001,video,""LaocoÃ¶n, El Greco (ASL)"",""<p>This is El Greco’s only painting of a mythological scene. LaocoÃ¶n, a priest in the city of Troy, warned his countrymen not to accept the gift of the Trojan horse, which concealed enemy Greek soldiers. The gods punished him by sending serpents to strangle him and his sons. El Greco set the Greek myth against his adopted Spanish city of Toledo, which appears in other paintings by the artist. The highly expressive color and energetic brush strokes are also hallmarks of El Greco’s highly individual style.</p>"

A portrait of his mistress Joanna Hiffernan posed in an informal housedress with flowing hair, an impassive expression, and standing on a white bearskin rug, told Victorians perhaps more than they wished to know about Hiffernan’s worldiness, yet is a tour de force of painted texture and a study of white.</p>"
4260555246001,video,""Wivenhoe Park, Essex, Constable (ASL)"",""<p>The big sky, lush green groves, and languidly grazing cows immediately evoke the calm tranquility of a pastoral landscape. Constable was born and raised in Suffolk, a county near Essex northeast of London, where he developed an attachment to the rural countryside. The owner of Wivenhoe Park, who was also a close friend of the artist’s father, commissioned this painting.</p>"
4260555247001,video,""The Small Crucifixion, GrÃ¼newald (ASL)"",""<p>This painting presents GrÃ¼newald’s empathetic portrayal of Christ’s pain and suffering in addition to his triumphs. The dramatic poses of the figures surrounding the cross, as well as the intense colors, emphasize the anguish of the moment. GrÃ¼newald also drew on the biblical accounts of this scene, in which Saint Luke described a “darkness over all the earth” at the time of Christ’s passing, by depicting a scene plunged into darkness by a solar eclipse.</p>"
4260555250001,video,""The Marquesa de Pontejos, Goya (ASL)"",""<p>Goya shows the marchesa dressed in the height of fashion with a wasp-waisted corset and the adoption of the “shepherdess” style popularized by Marie Antoinette. Her full skirt and broad-brimmed straw hat were also influenced by foreign fashions popular within Spain. The carnation she holds and the roses tucked into her skirt suggest that this portrait was probably painted on the occasion of her first marriage.</p>"

The boat’s home port, Gloucester, is lettered on the stern. Homer painted this scene during a postwar period during which many Americans longed for representations of a more innocent time. The painting enjoyed immediate popularity when exhibited in the country’s centennial year of 1876. Homer would turn increasingly to painting sea and seaside scenes, especially around Gloucester, Massachusetts.</p>"
4260555262001,video,""The Annunciation, Van Eyck (ASL)"",""<p>The tall narrow format of this painting suggests that this would have been the left wing of a triptych. Van Eyck emphasizes the meaning of the annunciation, the moment when Mary learns of the impending birth of Christ from the angel Gabriel, by including symbolic references to the Old Testament even as this story marks the start of the New Testament. For example, the floor tiles illustrate the stories of David and Goliath as well as Samson destroying the Philistine temple. Both foreshadow events of Christ’s life and the salvation of humankind.</p>"

It also touches on the Christian doctrine of resurrection. The painting shows a man who, stripped of his possessions, turns finally to prayer in a time of turbulence and uncertainty. Cole wrote of this painting that the forms in the sky represented suicide, intemperance, and murder. The man’s guardian angel shining from the upper corner gives hope for salvation.</p>"
4260558281001,video,""Shaw Memorial, Saint-Gaudens (ASL)"",""<p>Saint-Gaudens’s memorial commemorates the sacrifice of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw and the men of the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, the first black regiment to fight for the North in the Civil War. Half of the 600 men in the regiment were killed, captured, or missing after their assault on Fort Wagner, South Carolina on July 18, 1863. News of their bravery was spread immediately by both Union and Confederate troops. Saint-Gaudens completely reimagined the traditional equestrian monument by transforming the usual man on a horse into this frieze, which commemorates the soldiers as well as their leader, who was the first to die.</p>"

The work was painted when the twelve-year-old Farnese was sent by his grandfather, Pope Paul III, to become prior, or head of house, of a property belonging to the elite Knights of Malta, a religious order. He wears the Maltese cross on his robe. Ranuccio went on to craft an illustrious ecclesiastical career. Titian offers hints of the sitter’s future success with the resolute set of the boy’s shoulders and surprising sense of possession for one so young.</p>"

4786474065001,video,Science and Paper: Conserving a Drypoint by Michael Heizer,""<p>The issue of preservation arises frequently in discussions of land art and monumental outdoor sculpture, the type of work for which Michael Heizer is best known. For his <i>Scrap Metal Drypoints</i>, Heizer selected salvaged zinc and aluminum plates scarred with appealing scrapes, scratches, marks of oxidation, and corrosion—all dramatic evidence of environmental effects. In preparation for exhibition, conservators and curators, in consultation with the artist, elected to restore the clarity of one of the prints by mitigating the distracting staining and discoloration visible in the paper support. The challenge of handling and maneuvering the eight-foot-long print—particularly when swollen with water—requires seamless coordination. Over a period of three days, the monumental print was bathed in calcified water in a custom-built sink, removing much of the paper’s general discoloration. Once the print was lifted from the bath and dried under blotters, the conservators examined the remaining stains and selectively treated them by brushing and spraying weak solutions of bleach. A final bath removed all remaining chemical solutions from the paper. After a long period of drying, the print was hinged and framed for display in the exhibit <i>The Serial Impulse at Gemini G.E.L.</i></p>"

In 2010, the foundation awarded the Gallery a grant to conduct provenance research on the entire Kress collection of paintings, distributed nationwide to regional museums and study collections in university-affiliated institutions.&nbsp;In this lecture recorded on May 23, 2016, Melissa Beck Lemke reveals the history of Kress collection objects through documents, lantern slides, negatives, and photographs preserved in the Gallery’s department of image collections. The images were made throughout the 20<sup>th</sup> century and illustrate Kress’s collecting practices, as well as cleanings, restorations, and display of the individual objects. This program celebrates the 75-year relationship of the Samuel H. Kress Foundation and the National Gallery of Art, the enduring legacy of the Kress gifts nationwide, and recent research into the Kress Collection. <i>This program is supported by the Samuel H. Kress Foundation Provenance Research Project</i>.</p>"
5096907481001,video,Barbara Kruger: in her own words,""<p>This 6-minute film features works from the exhibition <i>In the Tower: Barbara Kruger</i>, presenting Kruger’s profile works—images of faces or figures seen in profile, over which the artist has layered attention-grabbing phrases and figures of speech. The film is narrated by the artist, who discusses her background, process, and methodology. It covers Kruger’s early career beginning in the 1970s as she transitioned from her work as a layout editor for CondÃ© Nast to the art world. By the end of the decade she had begun her “picture practice,” a conceptual approach that involved culling images from manuals and magazines and adding attention-grabbing language using her signature style of direct-address, complete with personal pronouns and active verbs. Kruger’s work now spans a variety of formats, from paste-ups to large-scale silkscreens and photographs, billboards, multichannel videos, and book-cover designs. This film was made possible by the HRH Foundation.</p>"

Mellon (1855–1937) was the original benefactor behind the National Gallery of Art, but neither the buildings nor the institution bears his name. In the late 1940s, Pittsburgh friends of Mr. Mellon proposed a memorial to honor his public service and philanthropy. The Andrew W. Mellon Memorial Fountain was dedicated in 1952. In 2015, the Gallery acquired jurisdiction over the property and immediately undertook a complete renovation to revive this beautiful memorial and public amenity.

5187654965001,video,""Woman in a Striped Dress, Vuillard (ASL)"",""<p>This painting is one of a set of five decorative works commissioned in 1895, all of which show intimate interior scenes, Vuillard's principal subject. All five display rich harmonies in a restricted range of color and densely arranged, intricate patterns. The introspective woman arranging flowers here perhaps represents the red-haired Misia, an accomplished pianist and wife of the patron of the series. Vuillard adopted the symbolist idea of synesthesia, whereby one sense can evoke another. The sumptuous visual qualities of Vuillard's reds in this work may suggest the lush chords of music that Misia performed.</p>"

5187668364001,video,""Untitled, Calder (ASL)"",""<p>After studying scale models of the Gallery’s East Building before it was complete, Calder composed the original maquette, or small three-dimensional model, of this mobile. Starting with the bottom arm and working progressively upward, he established the centering for each part before attaching it to the next higher, unfinished section. Once the model was complete, it was enlarged to 32 times its original size and was constructed from aluminum.</p>"
5189033665001,video,""One Year the Milkweed, Gorky (ASL)"",""<p>This is one of several so-called color veil paintings Gorky made in 1944, in which films of paint have been washed unevenly across the canvas and evocative but indistinct forms have been brushed in. Gorky thinned his paint with turpentine and might have applied it with a turkey baster. Overall green and brown hues suggest a landscape, but there are no identifiable landscape forms and no spatial recession. Instead, vertical drips and the alternation of light and deep tones create a shifting, shimmering effect across the surface of the canvas.</p>"
5189033670001,video,""Fresh Widow, Duchamp (ASL)"",""<p><i>Fresh Widow</i> is one of Duchamp’s “readymades”—commonplace objects that the artist signed and then exhibited as art. Working with a dealer in 1964, Duchamp oversaw the production of eight reproductions of his original <i>Fresh Widow</i>, of which this is the second. The title is a pun on the phrase “French window,” which alludes to both the doors commonly found in Parisian apartments and the new generation of widows created by World War I.</p>"

5189034170001,video,""Double America, Ligon (ASL)"",""<p>The top row of letters in this work are painted black and turned toward the wall so the viewer looks at the illuminated backs of the letters. The bottom row depicts the word upside down with the outward facing sides painted black, which allows the white neon light to reflect off the wall. This arrangement of skewed perspectives evokes the political turmoil caused by the election of America’s first black president and the country’s contemporaneous involvement in two wars.</p>"
5189035576001,video,""First Station, Newman (ASL)"",""<p>This painting is the first of 14 abstract representations of the Stations of the Cross, and it is also the first work to feature Newman’s signature “zips.” These vertical elements, which could be sharply or loosely defined, were used to punctuate the single-hued fields of his canvases. This series exemplifies Newman’s efforts to blend abstract expressionism with mystical and spiritual subjects.</p>"
5189035580001,video,""Untitled, Judd (ASL)"",""<p>This piece was created during a crucial turning-point in Judd’s career, when he moved from painting to overseeing the construction of large but simple three-dimensional objects. This piece sits on the ground without a pedestal, directly in the space of the viewer, and is unframed and exposed in a way that almost no previous sculpture had been. Judd took aim at what he saw as the continuing illusionism of European modernism, pursuing instead a purely lucid form that would exist simply as an object.</p>"
5189035583001,video,""Beta Kappa, Louis (ASL)"",""<p>Louis was a leader of the local Washington Color School, a branch of the larger color field movement. He is best known for experimenting with a process called staining, in which he diluted acrylic paints and poured them onto unprimed canvas. He then tipped, bent, or folded the canvas or its support to control how the color moved over the surface.</p>"
5189037257001,video,""Number 1, 1950 (Lavender Mist), Pollock (ASL)"",""<p>Pollock’s drip painting technique was instrumental in the development of action painting, one method of the abstract expressionist style. Abstract expressionist painters sought to create works that evoked pure emotion from the viewer. In this piece, splashing lines, puddles, and drips create multiple layers that suggest energy and depth. The result seems spontaneous yet controlled, intuitive yet thoughtfully considered.</p>"
5189037263001,video,""Tiger, Kelly (ASL)"",""<p>This work was created while Kelly was working in France from 1948 to 1954—a period when he realized his first abstractions. This was the first time he used differently sized, individually crafted stretchers in one painting, lending special significance to this work of his early oeuvre. Kelly's abstract works are derived intuitively, even though they may appear to be based on mathematical formulae, such as the ratio of one panel to another or to the work as a whole.</p>"
5189040657001,video,""Untitled (Red Hand), Paik (ASL)"",""<p>Paik was born in Seoul, South Korea, but grew up and lived in Japan, Germany, and, finally, New York. Paik pioneered the use of new media, including video, in art. For this work, Paik altered a 19th-century Japanese scroll by adding his handprint and placing a flashing red light behind it. The juxtaposition of a traditional art form with modern technology would become a hallmark of Paik’s work.</p>"
5189040663001,video,""Still Life: Le Jour, Braque (ASL)"",""<p>Braque famously worked alongside Pablo Picasso as the two developed the new style of cubism around 1910. This painting is typical of a later phase in Braque’s career, when he incorporated elements of cubism into still lifes and other subjects. In this work, the wood grain on the table, the design of the wallpaper in the background, and the text on the newspaper emphasize the interplay of pattern and texture.</p>"

5189040686001,video,""Head of a Woman, Modigliani (ASL)"",""<p>This is the only sculpture by Modigliani in the Gallery’s collection, which otherwise features his painted portraits and nudes. However, this sculpture reflects the artist’s distinctive stylization of the figure with the elongated features and almond-shaped eyes found in many of his paintings. Modigliani focused on sculpture from about 1909 to 1914, before his death from tuberculosis at age 35 in 1920.</p>"
5189040691001,video,""Hope is: Wanting to Pull Clouds, Polke (ASL)"",""<p>The boy in this work was probably inspired by a 15th- or 16th-century German print; he is shown pulling ropes, perhaps symbolizing his effort to reach for the clouds. To create the background, Polke stitched together fragments of fabric and dipped the resulting surface in polyester resin. He then poured paint on the back of the work and shifted the canvas to create different shapes. Finally, he painted the figure itself. All told, this work took Polke a year to complete.</p>"
5189044194001,video,""Piano mÃ©canique, Mitchell (ASL)"",""<p>Mitchell was a leading figure in the group of artists known as the second generation of abstract expressionists. In this painting, the bold, animated lines against a white ground capture Mitchell’s spontaneous and impulsive painting method. She often drew upon childhood memories of Lake Michigan when composing paintings, some of which she called “expressionist landscapes.” Because they are totally abstract, the viewer is invited to connect to her works on an emotional level.</p>"
5189044200001,video,""FaÃ§ades d’immeubles (Building FaÃ§ades), Dubuffet (ASL)"",""<p>The rough texture, somber color palette, and coarse style of Dubuffet’s paintings confront the viewer with their directness. In this work, he depicts a city in a graffiti-like figurative style. He created the animated, crudely drawn stick figures of this postwar apartment complex by scratching through black paint to reveal hidden, delicate colors beneath.</p>"
5189044201001,video,""Tableau No. IV; Lozenge Composition with Red, Gray, Blue, Yellow, and Black, Mondrian (ASL)"",""<p>Though totally abstract, Mondrian’s “neo-plastic” paintings attempt to capture the complex equilibrium found in nature. The reduced color palette and stark opposition of black vertical and horizontal lines against blocks of white and primary colors were meant to spiritually represent natural harmony. This was the first neo-plastic painting to be created in the lozenge, or diamond, format.</p>"
5189044207001,video,""Improvisation 31 (Sea Battle), Kandinsky (ASL)"",""<p>Kandinsky created dozens of compositions he called “improvisations” from 1909 to 1913. In this work, strong black lines and scrubbed patches of color course across the canvas, but their movement is constrained by a monumental triangular composition. The use of the term “improvisation” suggests spontaneous expression, while “sea battle” evokes a military engagement.</p>"
5189044236001,video,""Great America, Marshall (ASL)"",""<p>This painting reimagines a boat ride into a haunted tunnel at an amusement park as the Middle Passage—the forced journey of slaves from Africa to the Americas. What might in other hands be a work of heavy irony becomes instead a delicate interweaving of the histories of painting and race. The canvas, which is stretched directly onto the wall, creates a screen or backdrop onto which viewers project their own associations triggered by the powerful imagery.</p>"
5189048833001,video,""Ground Swell, Hopper (ASL)"",""<p>Hopper painted this work in South Truro, Massachusetts, where he and his wife had built a home and studio in 1934. Despite its bright palette and seemingly serene subject, <i>Ground Swell</i> echoes the themes of loneliness and escape typical of Hopper’s oeuvre. The blue sky, sun-kissed figures, and vast rolling water strike a calm note; however, the visible disengagement of the figures from each other and their noticeable preoccupation with the bell buoy at the center of the canvas belie the initial sense of serenity.</p>"

5189049227001,video,""Look Mickey, Lichtenstein (ASL)"",""<p>This painting was the first for which Lichtenstein borrowed an image directly from popular culture: a children’s book called <i>Donald Duck: Lost and Found</i>. He began this work by making a sketch from his source and then recomposing the image for narrative and formal purposes. He traced the drawing onto a canvas, making more adjustments, and then painted the dots using a perforated metal screen as a stencil, imitating industrial printing techniques. Lichtenstein would later refer to this work as his first pop art painting.</p>"
5189049243001,video,""No More Play, Giacometti (ASL)"",""<p>One of the great surrealist sculptors, Giacometti often incorporated themes of games and play into his early work, as with this piece. The form the artist uses here resembles a board game with moveable pieces, yet the nature of the game is unclear. The ambiguous space and unknowable rules of the “game” represented in <i>No More Play</i> make this piece feel like an object one might encounter in a dream.</p>"
5189049245001,video,""Two Girls under an Umbrella, Kirchner (ASL)"",""<p>This work dates to early in Kirchner’s prolific career, when he was a founding member of the expressionist group called Die BrÃ¼cke, or The Bridge, in Dresden in 1905. In this painting, Kirchner has depicted two nudes in a natural setting, rather than in the contrived space of an academic studio. This work is also an example of the artist’s use of bold, often crude, forms and vibrant color.&nbsp;</p>"
5189049248001,video,""Open Window, Collioure, Matisse (ASL)"",""<p>Matisse’s work as a fauvist painter was one phase in a lifelong engagement with color. This small but explosive work is celebrated as one of the most important early paintings of the fauve school, a style distinguished by a startling palette of saturated, unmixed colors and broad brushstrokes. This work was painted in Collioure, a small town on the Mediterranean coast of France, to which Matisse traveled in the summer of 1905 with AndrÃ© Derain, a fellow fauvist painter.</p>"
5189049249001,audio,""Charing Cross Bridge, London, Derain (ASL)"",""<p>This work is typical of the Fauvist style, which Derain developed alongside Henri Matisse, featuring vibrant and unblended colors. This scene was painted when Derain visited London and captured similar subjects to those Monet had famously painted just a few years previously, though Derain’s color palette and perspective on the scenes contrast sharply with the impressionist master’s work.</p>"
5189049252001,video,""Jack-in-the-Pulpit No. IV, O’Keeffe (ASL)"",""<p>O’Keeffe, an important artist in the development of American modernism, is best known today for her abstracted representations of flowers. This painting is one of a series of six depictions of jack-in-the-pulpit flowers, which the artist would have found near her husband’s family estate in Lake George, New York. Each painting in the series zooms in closer to the center of the flower and becomes more abstract.</p>"
5189053067001,video,""Family of Saltimbanques, Picasso (ASL)"",""<p>This painting shows a group of itinerant, socially marginalized circus performers who would have traveled from town to town to earn a living. Though the figures in this work stand close to one another, they are emotionally remote. The bleak, featureless landscape enhances the feeling of isolation and estrangement. This early work could reflect the sympathy Picasso felt for those who shared the transient lifestyle he had experienced in Paris before settling in a ramshackle apartment in Montemarte in 1904, a year before this was painted.</p>"
5189053071001,video,""New York, Bellows (ASL)"",""<p>Bellows became known early in his career for his uncompromising depictions of New York City, where he studied art and lived for 20 years until his death in 1925. As a major figure in the Ashcan School of urban realists, Bellows’s work captured the raw reality of everyday life in the city. This painting shows the corner of Madison Square at Broadway and Twenty-Third Street, which was notorious for its glut of advertising signs, including the city’s first electric sign.</p>"
5191292367001,video,Hubert Robert at the Flower-Strewn Abyss,""<p>Nina L. Dubin, associate professor of art history, University of Illinois at Chicago. On the occasion of the exhibition <i>Hubert Robert, 1733–1808 </i>at the National Gallery of Art<i>,</i> Nina Dubin presented a lecture on September 26, 2016, that examined a series of Hubert Robert’s paintings from the 1780s. The theme of these works is courtship menaced by the potential for calamity. Male suitors climb ladders in an attempt to procure flowers for their female love interests or cling to tree branches while trying to secure a token of their affection in the form of a bird’s nest. No less than his contemporaneous views of Paris—evocations of a city vacillating between prosperity and ruin—Robert’s chronicles of the rise and potential fall of a man in love embody the suspenseful confluence of dread and hope that characterized the prerevolutionary period. As Dubin argues, it is no accident that in such a climate, Robert would take up the theme of a lover’s potential mishap: along with the ancient myths of Icarus, Phaethon, and others who fatally believed they could defy the force of gravity, the folly of love furnished eighteenth-century audiences with a shorthand means of coming to terms with the dawning ethereality—the manias, fads, and bubbles—of modern existence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>"

Mellon Professor, Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts, National Gallery of Art. The Tuscan sculptor Francesco Mochi (1580-1654) has long been viewed as an early innovator of the baroque style whose career was eclipsed by his brilliant younger contemporary Gianlorenzo Bernini. But for his 17th-century biographer, what distinguished Mochi’s sculpture was his determination to adhere to “the Florentine manner.” Estelle Lingo’s new book, <i>Mochi’s Edge and Bernini’s Baroque</i>, argues that the religious and political climate of the later 16th century posed specific challenges for the medium of sculpture, particularly as it had been practiced by Florentine sculptors, most famously Michelangelo. In this lecture held on April 29, 2018, Lingo explores how Mochi’s distinctive sculptural style emerged directly from his attempt to carry forward this 16th-century Florentine tradition and to adapt it to the exigencies of a new era. Mochi’s ambitious undertaking produced some of the century’s most breathtaking and technically sophisticated sculptures, but its inherent tensions also offer new ways of understanding the formation and rise to dominance of Bernini’s mature sculptural style.</p>"
5819175830001,video,Elson Lecture Series 2018: Janine Antoni,""<p>Janine Antoni (b. 1964, Freeport, Bahamas) received her BA in 1986 from Sarah Lawrence College in New York before earning her MFA from the Rhode Island School of Design in 1989. In the early 1990s, she began to perform mundane rituals—eating, sleeping, and washing—and transformed them into sculptures, centering attention on creative processes. Over a nearly 30-year career, her conceptual works have utilized an expansive variety of materials (from food to stone) and mediums (including photography, solo and collaborative performance, sculpture, and video) to emphasize the meanings attached to art-making. In 1993, Antoni created <i>Lick and Lather</i>, a set of 14 self-portrait busts, seven in chocolate and seven in soap. Initially the busts looked identical to each other, and to Antoni, until the artist licked the chocolate busts and bathed with the soap, effacing them to create a collective portrait of artistic presence and absence, likeness and alienation. <i>Lick and Lather</i> also reflects on the history of representation: the chocolate and soap recall both the classical bronze and marble sculptures of antiquity and the variable nature of cast sculpture, all while questioning ideals of female beauty and desire. The set of <i>Lick and Lather</i> at the National Gallery of Art, the only iteration of the project that features all fourteen busts, comprises the fullest picture of Antoni’s concept. On March 1, 2018, as part of the Elson Lecture Series, Antoni discusses her career and latest projects.<br>"

Jacopo Ligozzi (1547–1627), a celebrated draftsman and then head of the Academy of Drawing in Florence, created 22 preparatory drawings in 1608 that were subsequently etched or engraved into full-page plates for the volume. It is the centerpiece of the exhibition <i>Heavenly Earth: Images of Saint Francis at La Verna</i> on view at the National Gallery of Art through July 8, 2018. In this lecture held on June 24, 2018, Ginger Hammer expands on the art-historical context of traditional representations of Saint Francis at La Verna and the innovations in Franciscan subject matter characteristic of the Counter-Reformation.</p>"

Ailsa Mellon Bruce was the only daughter of Andrew Mellon, the founder of the National Gallery of Art, and a patron of the Gallery since 1941.

5834436188001,video,Introduction to the Exhibition—Corot: Women,""<p>Mary Morton, curator and head, department of French paintings, National Gallery of Art. Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot is best known as the great master of landscape painting in the 19th century who bridged the French neoclassical tradition with the impressionist movement of the 1870s. In honor of the opening of the exhibition Corot: Women, Mary Morton argues that Corot’s figure paintings, although constituting a much smaller, less well-known portion of his oeuvre, are of equal importance to the history of art, in particular for the founders of modernist painting such as Paul CÃ©zanne, Pablo Picasso, and Georges Braque. Dressed in rustic Italian costume or nude on a grassy plain, Corot’s women read, dream, and gaze directly at the viewer, conveying a sense of their inner lives. On September 9, 2018, at that National Gallery of Art, Morton explains how Corot’s sophisticated use of color and his deft, delicate touch applied to the female form resulted in pictures of quiet majesty. Corot: Women is on view through December 31, 2018.<br>"

Unlike works of minimalist art, which generally feature repeated, hard geometric forms that have typically been fabricated in workshops, postminimalist works are often made of soft materials that have been manipulated by the artist directly. Folded, poured, dropped, or scattered, these works incorporate gravity into the aesthetic result, causing the viewer to imagine these actions and the body of the artist or installer who made the sculpture.</p>"
